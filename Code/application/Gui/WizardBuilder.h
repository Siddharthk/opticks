/**
 *  A widget in which to chain plug-in and desktop service items together in sequence
 *  to create a wizard.
 *
 *  The WizardBuilder widget allows sequencing of plug-ins, desktop services, and
 *  specific values by manipulating items on a canvas displayed in a view widget.  The
 *  wizard builder looks similar to an application in that it has its own menu bar,
 *  toolbar, and status bar.  The central part of the wizard builder is split into two
 *  main widgets, the view and a parameters widget.
 *
 *  The view widget displays the desktop, plug-in, and specific value canvas items.  The
 *  items can be added by calling addDesktopItem(), addPlugInItem(), and addValueItem().
 *  The items contains various input and output arguments that can be connected to form
 *  a sequence of events.
 *
 *  The parameters widget contains numerous child widgets to set various parameters of the
 *  overall wizard.  The wizard and each item can be set for batch mode or interactive mode
 *  execution.  The input and output arguments for selected items are listed according to
 *  their name, type, item name, and item execution order.  Items can be connected with
 *  the connectItems() method, which uses the selected input and output argument.
 *
 *  Each item has a unique execution order identifier.  The order may be incremented for
 *  an item with the increaseCurrentItemOrder() and decreaseCurrentItemOrder() methods.
 *
 *  The wizard builder also allows saving and loading the current canvas configuration with
 *  openWizard() and saveWizard().
 *
