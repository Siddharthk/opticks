 *  The view widget for the wizard canvas items.
 *
 *  A WizardView object is the actual widget to display the items on the wizard canvas.
 *  These items include the wizard items themselves, connection lines, and selection nodes.
 *  The WizardView allows manipulation of the item layout and configuration.  Wizard items
 *  and connection lines can be selected with the selectItem() method.  Selection nodes
 *  are then created for the item and displayed.  Their initial z-order is set starting with
 *  10000 and increasing with each node, so items should have a z-order of less than 10000
 *  for the nodes to be displayed on top.  Wizard items must be deleted by calling
 *  deleteSelectedItems() for selection node clean-up.
