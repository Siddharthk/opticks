/**
 * @mainpage Opticks - Plug-In Interface Specification
 *
 * <h2>Getting Started:</h2>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Look at the \ref howtos page.
 * It contains a general plug-in development tutorial and informative howtos on various parts of the %Opticks SDK.
 * <li>There are sample %Opticks plug-ins provided in the
 * Toolkit\\Application\\PlugIns\\src folder of a %Opticks Installation provided
 * the Developer's Toolkit was installed.</li>
 * <li>The %Opticks Plug-In Interface is divided into four parts, Interfaces,
 * PlugInUtilities, PlugInLib and HdfPlugInLib which are all documented here
 * together, a explanation of each part is provided below:
 *   <ul><li>The Toolkit\\Application\\Interfaces folder provides the base
 * interface for the %Opticks application, ie. the API of %Opticks that plug-ins
 * can interact with.</li>
 *     <li>The Toolkit\\Application\\PlugInUtilities provides helper and
 * convenience classes that can be compiled into %Opticks plug-ins to make using
 * the %Opticks API a little easier; you should look here often.</li>
 *     <li>The Toolkit\\Application\\PlugInLib provides code that you should
 * subclass and include into your %Opticks plug-in so that the %Opticks Application
 * can locate and access your plug-in.</li>
 *     <li>The Toolkit\\Application\\HdfPlugInLib provides code to make it
 * easier for plug-in developers to work with datafiles using the HDF4 or
 * HDF5 file specification.</li>
 *   </ul>
 * </ul>
