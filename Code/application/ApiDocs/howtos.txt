/** \page howtos Getting Started with Opticks Plug-in Development
If you are new to %Opticks plug-in development, this tutorial is a good place to start.
The following tutorials and HOWTOs assume you have some C++ knowledge including a basic understanding of virtual functions.
There is some documentation on setting up a build environment but it is also assumed that you know how to build dynamic libraries (.dll files on Windows and .so files on Solaris) on your platform.
If you have some %Opticks plug-in development experience, try the more targeted HOWTOs.
See the \ref main "SDK documentation" if you need information on specific classes and methods.
The Related Pages section lists protocol and file format descriptions, and other reference documentation not specific to a class or method.
The sample plug-ins are working examples and test plug-ins which provide concrete examples without narrative explanation.

The %Opticks SDK contains the tutorial and sample plug-ins that are referenced in this Tutorial.
You can download the %Opticks SDK from the <a href="https://opticks.ballforge.net/servlets/ProjectProcess?tab=1">Downloads</a> page of the https://opticks.ballforge.net/ website.
