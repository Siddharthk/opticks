Qt 4.3.1 is also required (http://trolltech.com/downloads). However due to licensing restrictions, you must build 
it manually. Instructions on building Qt are listed below.

Once you download these dependencies, set the environment variable named OPTICKDEPENDENCIES to the folder where 
the dependencies were unzipped to.   


Instructions on building Qt:
------------------------------------------ 

(Please note that there are only 32-bit binary builds of Qt available from TrollTech. Because of this, 
in order to run Qt in 64-bit, Qt must be manually built on windows in both 32-bit and 64-bit binary builds.)


Things to do before building Qt:


-  First extract the Qt zip file to a directory on your system.

-  If you plan on building a 64-bit version of Qt, make a copy of the extracted Qt directory to another one, 
   but add 64-bit to end of the new directory name. This new directory will be used to make the Qt 64-bit binary 
   build. (For example if the name of the extracted Qt directory is Qt-win-src, then the name would be 
   Qt-win-src-64-bit).   


A. Building the 32-bit version:


1. To make the 32-bit build of Qt, go to Visual Studio 2005->Visual Studio tools in the start menu and click on 
   Visual Studio 2005 Command Prompt.

2. In the Command Prompt, go to the 32-bit Qt directory you just extracted.

3. Once you in the directory, type:

	configure.exe -qt-gif -qt-libpng -qt-libmng -qt-libtiff -qt-libjpeg

   This will generate a Makefile.
   
4. Now to start the compilation, run nmake by typing:

	nmake

5. Once the compilation is complete, then type:

	nmake install

   The reason for doing this is so you will only need the include directory from Qt, not the src one. 
   
6. The 32-bit binary build of Qt is now done.


B. Building the 64-bit version:  


1. To make the 64-bit build of Qt, go to Visual Studio 2005->Visual Studio tools in the start menu and click on 
   Visual Studio 2005 x64 Win64 Command Prompt.

2. In the Command Prompt, go to the 64-bit Qt directory you just extracted.

3. Once you in the directory, type:

	configure.exe -qt-gif -qt-libpng -qt-libmng -qt-libtiff -qt-libjpeg

   This will generate a Makefile.
   
4. Now to start the compilation, run nmake by typing:

	nmake

5. Once the compilation is complete, then type:

	nmake install

   The reason for doing this is so you will only need the include directory from Qt, not the src one. 

6. The 64-bit binary build of Qt is now done.

C. Setting up the folders:


Once Qt is done building, don't move it to the dependencies folder just yet. You will still need to do some work
on the files.

1. Create a new directory named Qt in the dependencies folder.

2. Inside the new Qt directory, Create the following 4 folders: bin, include, lib, and plugins.

3. Inside each of these folders, Make a win32 folder if you are using the 32-bit version or a x64 folder if you 
   are using the 64-bit version.

4. Copy all of the folders in the old Qt directory include folder and paste them in the new directory 
   include -> win32/x64 folder.

5. Next go to the old Qt directory bin folder and copy all of the .dll files as well as the mac.exe, qmake.exe,
   rcc.exe, and uic.exe. Paste these files in the new Qt directory bin -> win32/x64 folder.

6. Also copy the .pdb files located in the old Qt directory lib folder and paste them in the new directory 
   bin -> win32/x64 folder.

7. Now Move all of the .lib files in the old directory lib folder and put them in the new Qt directory
   lib -> win32/x64 folder.

8. Go to the plugins win32/x64 folder in the new Qt directory and create a new folder named imageformats.

9. In the plugin -> imageformats folder in the old directory, copy all files expect the .exp and .ilk files.
   Paste these in the plugins -> win32/x64 -> imagefromats located in the new Qt directory.

10. Qt is now ready to run with Visual Studio. 


Opening the source code in Visual Studio
---------------------------------------------------

To get to the Opticks source code in Visual Studio, open the Opticks.sln file in Visual Studio. This should be 
located in the application folder.


How to compile and run Opticks though Visual Studio
------------------------------------------------------------

Once the dependencies are set, you are now able to build the code. However, when you try to run it, you may get 
an error. This is because the environment variables do not point to the right .dll files.

To set the variables to the right file path, you must follow these steps:

1. Make sure that Visual studio is shut down.

2. Go to the application folder, here you should see a file named Opticks.vcproj.FILLINUSERNAME.user.template.	

3. Change FILLINUSERNAME to your user name and remove the template file extension. You may need to remove the existing
   .user file.
	Example: Opticks.vcproj.username.user

4. Once this is done, the environment variables should be pointing to the .dll files and Opticks can now be able 
to run in Visual Studio.
