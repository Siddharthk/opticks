<p>There are no royalties or other fees to be paid for use of
software from GnuWin32, and GnuWin32 does not impose licenses other than those 
that hold for the original sources. You may redistribute GnuWin32 programs, e.g. 
by bundling the binaries with other software and distributing these as a 
single work, e.g. on a CD-ROM. It seems fair that when you redistribute programs 
from GnuWin32 develop your own programs using libraries from GnuWin32, you 
clearly document the origin of the programs and the libraries inside the package as well as on the website where the 
package is distributed or sold. If you sell GnuWin32 programs or programs 
developed using libraries from GnuWin32, you might consider making a
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/project_donations.php?group_id=23617">
donation</a> to the GnuWin32 project.</p>

<p>Read carefully the copyright or other licenses included in the
package; usually in the directories contrib or src. For example
if the license of a package is the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GNU General
Public License</a> (GPL), you MUST provide the source code of any program you
have made with the help of this package. Other licenses may have
similar clauses. Some licenses, e.g. the GPL, also have a clause that if you 
demand a fee for the programs, anyone who has paid the fee, may redistribute the 
programs for free. This right to free redistribution may even hold for programs 
that have been developed using libraries from GnuWin32! </p>

<p>The open source license used most often, as measured by the
use of licenses on <a href="http://freshmeat.net/browse/14/">Freshmeat</a>,
is the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GNU General
Public License</a> (GPL). Some other licenses are the <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html">GNU Lesser General
Public License</a> (LGPL) and the <a
href="http://www.freebsd.org/copyright/copyright.html">BSD
License</a>. More open source licenses may be found at the <a
href="http://opensource.org/licenses">Open Source Initiative</a>.</p>

<p><em>Does the use of GPL'ed DLLs from the GnuWin32 project in your
program need you to release your program under GPL too?</em></p>

<p>There seem to be two different strands of opinion. The <a
href="http://www.fsf.org">FSF</a> holds that dynamic linking
creates a derivative work, and so any program designed to run
with a GPL-ed DLL, must be GPL itself; see <a
href="http://www.fsf.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html" target="_new">http://www.fsf.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html</a>.
The only exception they make is for DLL's that come with the
compiler and the kernel, such as the MS VC run-time DLL's; see <a
href="http://www.fsf.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#WindowsRuntimeAndGPL"
target="_new">http://www.fsf.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#WindowsRuntimeAndGPL</a>.
On the other hand some OpenSource lawyers hold that dynamically
linking does not make your program GPL. See <a
href="http://www.nusphere.com/products/library/gpl_0401openmag.pdf"
target="_new">http://www.nusphere.com/products/library/gpl_0401openmag.pdf</a>
and the discussion in <a
href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article.php?sid=6366"
target="_new">http://www.linuxjournal.com/article.php?sid=6366</a>.
There is no doubt that programs that link dynamically to DLL's
from libraries with the <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html">LGPL</a> or with
the GPL with <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#TOCLinkingOverControlledInterface">special
provisions</a>, are GPL free if you decide so.</p>
